Create a high-quality hyper-realistic digital painting in the style of a traditional oil painting. Reproduce the original composition, lighting, scene, and emotional atmosphere exactly as in the reference image, including all interior details, props, colors, and light direction.
 
Preserve every aspect of the setting and figures â€” including expressions, clothing, posture, body orientation, and eye contact direction. Replace only the faces, hairstyles, and skin tones of the figures using the provided portrait references, while ensuring that the facial features match those in the template image exactly.
 
Integrate the new features seamlessly, maintaining realistic lighting, emotional coherence, and a painterly brush texture consistent with traditional oil painting techniques. Ensure the fusion of the swapped features feels natural and artistically authentic.
Make sure the image that you generate is of equal dimensions.
