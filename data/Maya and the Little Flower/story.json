		"1": "In a small town on the edge of a quiet forest, a young girl named Maya tended to a tiny flower she had planted in her backyard.  It was a bright purple bloom with a golden center, and Maya named it Lila.",
		"2": "One afternoon, dark clouds rolled in. Thunder cracked through the sky, and rain began to pour. Maya watched from her window, worried. The flower was too small to withstand the storm.",
		"3": "Maya ran outside with a small plastic cover in her hand. As she reached the flower, she slipped in the mud and fell to her knees. She scrambled up, soaked and muddy, determined to protect Lila.",
		"4": "Just then, her neighbor, Mrs. Thompson, appeared holding a large umbrella. 'Need a hand, Maya?' she asked with a warm smile.",
		"5": "Together, they carefully placed the cover over the flower and used the umbrella to shield Maya from the pouring rain.",
		"6": "'Why did you come to help me?' Maya asked. 'You didnâ€™t have to.'",
		"7": "'Kindness is something we choose,' Mrs. Thompson said. 'Helping each other makes the world a better place.'",
		"8": "The storm eventually passed. The sun peeked through the clouds, and Lila, safe and sound, stretched toward the light.",
		"9": "From that day on, Maya visited Mrs. Thompson often. They gardened together, shared stories, and cared for the plants in both of their yards.",
		"10": "And the flower? It grew tall and strong-just like the bond between Maya and her kind neighbor."
